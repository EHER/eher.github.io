My first post

This is my first post.

I'll try to use this blog to keep track of what I am doing.

The idea is to have something really simple to update and keep.

So I'll start using [BashBlog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) to generate the blog (in static files) using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

And nothing more confortable for a [web developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer) than use [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) as hosting.

Lets see how much can I share here.
