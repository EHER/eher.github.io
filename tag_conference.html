<p>DomCode is a non-profit event based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Two tracks of local and international speakers covering modern development, hosted in a friendly environment.</p>

<p>I attended to DomCode 2016 and here is my track.</p>

<h1>My track</h1>

<p>Here is the list of talks that I was attending to on the conference.</p>

<h2>Here be dragons! What it's really like to slay a monolith</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/greydnls">Grahan Daniels</a></p>

<p>The prospect of transitioning from a legacy monolithic application towards a group of purpose built services sounds like a dream. In reality, it's most often an epic journey wrought with trials and tribulations.</p>

<p>In this talk you will learn how one of the fastest growing new media companies shifted from a half decade old Kohana application onto a platform comprised of micro services. We'll cover how to treat your APIs like first class citizens, the thought process behind architecting a stable publishing platform, and all of the lessons we learned along the way.</p>

<h2>Exeperience building apps with react native</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adrian_philipp">Adrian Philipp</a></p>

<p>React Native is all about combining great user experience on native platforms with the developer experience of React on the web. Since it’s start 1.5 years ago, React Native continuously enjoys a tremendous traction. In 2015 React got popular, I believe 2017 will be the year of React Native. I followed the development since the start and now built several React Native apps. During my talk I like to introduce the library, show useful tooling and give practical advice for building React Native apps.</p>

<h2>Oops! OOPS's not what i thought</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/anjanavakil">Anjana Vakil</a></p>

<p>In this talk we'll go on a historical and philosophical journey deep into the heart of object-oriented programming (OOP). Come along with me as I have my world shaken by the discovery that objects and classes are not the most important concepts in OOP: messages and late binding are. Join me as we try to peek inside the heads of Alan Kay and the other founders of the paradigm as they were developing early object-oriented languages like Smalltalk, only to discover that those "old" ideas seem strikingly relevant today. We may even feel our jaws drop as we realize that OOP and functional programming are not as different as we may have thought, and that the first object-oriented language was not created in the 60's or 70's but much, much earlier…</p>

<p>What awaits us at the end of this journey? At worst, we'll experience a brief crisis of faith in everything we ever thought we knew about programming. (A support group will meet after the conference.) At best, we'll shift the way we view this near-ubiquitous but oft-misunderstood programming paradigm, and walk away with new insights for how we architect and understand our code.</p>

<h2>Distributed disarray</h2>

<p>Laurens Duijvesteijn</p>

<p>Can you build a skyscraper in a swamp? With a solid foundation, you might.</p>

<p>In this talk we'll cover some of the ridiculous things you're going to have to put up with if you want to execute your application on multiple computers. Highlights include the laws of physics and Murphy, "random" numbers, timezones plus all the fun that comes with them, and the network.</p>

<h2>How do kids program in the wild?</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/felienne">Felienne Hermans</a></p>

<p>Scratch is an amazingly popular programming language for kids, with 14 million public programs available in their online repository. But, what do kids do in their programs? Are their programs simple or complex? Do they apply programming concepts or do they just play with the blocks? Do kids develop good programming habits? Are there common code patterns?</p>

<p>To answer those questions, we scraped the Scratch repository, retrieved 250,000 projects and performed source code analysis on them.</p>

<h2>How to effectively grow a development team</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jeroenvdgulik">Jeroen vd Gulik</a></p>

<p>Developers come in all forms and sizes but putting them together doesn't automatically transform them into a team. One of the keys to creating a successful team of developers in my opinion is a great developer culture. In this talk I will try to explain why developer culture is so important and share how we grew a developer culture for one of the biggest airports in Europe.</p>

<h2>Ethics &amp; human rights in a digital society</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ncilla">Ancilla van de Leest</a></p>

<p>In an environment with endless technical possibilities and need for convenience, what safeguards do we have to protect ourselves from commercial exploitation? What can we expect from our politicians? Does an individual citizen hold any responsibility for our mutual future and that of coming generations? What accountability do companies hold? Answers to these question, and more insights from Ancilla.</p>
