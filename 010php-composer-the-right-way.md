Composer has triggered a renaissance in the PHP community, it has changed the way we deal with other people’s code and it has changed the way we share our code.
We are all slowly moving to using Composer, from Wordpress to Joomla and Drupal and frameworks in between.
But many of us mistreat composer, follow outdated practices or simply lack a few tricks. In this session i’ll get you the low down on how to use composer the right way.
